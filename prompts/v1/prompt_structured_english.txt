You are an expert agronomist specialized in extracting structured experimental data from scientific reports.

## Task
Analyze this image from an agricultural experimental report. Extract ALL measured variables (traits) that you can identify from tables, figures, and text sections (especially "Materials and Methods" and "Results").

## Output Format
Return a JSON array. Each object MUST have exactly these 5 fields:
- "trait_id": A short uppercase code using underscores (e.g., PM_LEAF_FREQ). Use domain conventions.
- "description": A concise description in English (1 sentence max).
- "trait": A detailed definition of what is measured, in English.
- "method": The measurement method (e.g., "visual estimation", "counting", "weighing"). Use null if unknown.
- "unit": The unit of measurement (e.g., "%", "kg", "nb"). Use null if not specified.

## Example
Input: A table showing downy mildew frequency on leaves measured by visual estimation in percentage.

Output:
```json
[
  {
    "trait_id": "PM_LEAF_FREQ",
    "description": "Frequency of downy mildew attack on leaves",
    "trait": "frequency of leaves showing downy mildew symptoms",
    "method": "visual estimation",
    "unit": "%"
  },
  {
    "trait_id": "PM_LEAF_INT",
    "description": "Intensity of downy mildew attack on leaves",
    "trait": "percentage of leaf surface affected by downy mildew symptoms",
    "method": "visual estimation",
    "unit": "%"
  }
]
```

## Rules
1. Extract EVERY variable you can find, do not skip any.
2. If a field value is uncertain, provide your best estimate rather than omitting it.
3. If a field is truly unknown, use null.
4. Return ONLY the JSON array. No explanations, no markdown formatting, no extra text.
5. Ensure the JSON is valid and parseable.
