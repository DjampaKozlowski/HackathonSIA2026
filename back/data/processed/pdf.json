EOR ACCREDITATION** ......................................................................................................... 43\n\n#### **SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS**\n\n\nThis trial was carried out in a crop of Vinra ( _Vitis vinifera_ ) white Victoria variety in a pot on\n14/03/2024 and ended on 05/07/2024. 3 theses were established with 4 plots for each of them. Each\nplot is made up of 7 plants in 10 liter pots, having a theoretical framework of application of 2.4m x\n1.6m i.e. 3.84m2 per plant, 107.52m2 per thesis. Three applications were made during the course of\nthe trial: the first was carried out on 18/03/2024 with the culture in phenological stage BBCH 07, the\nsecond application was carried out on 05/04/2024 with BBCH stage 18 and the last on 21/06/2024\nwith BBCH 53 status. The planting density was 2,604.00 plants/ha\n\n\nThe following parameters were evaluated in the crop: vigor, bud breakage, plant height, SPAD,\nleaf area, fresh aboveground and root biomass.\n\n\nIn summary, it can be concluded under the conditions tested:\n\n\n`o` **Vigor.** Vigor is improved in the T2-Product B and T3-Cepacet treatments by 4.89% and 8.42%\n\nrespectively at the time of evaluation 95DDT.\n\n`o` **Stem length.** This parameter is improved in the three evaluations carried out, with the T2\nProduct B treatment yielding the best results.\n\n`o` **SPAD.** None of the proposed treatments improves this parameter.\n\n\n`o` **Leaf area.** The T2-Product B treatment progressively improves the leaf area until higher than\n\ncontrol values are obtained.\n\n`o` **Fresh aboveground and root biomass.** The T2-Product B treatment improves the volume of\n\nfresh aboveground biomass, the rest of the treatments do not seem to improve this\nparameter.\n\n`o` **Phytotoxicity** . No symptoms of phytotoxicity were observed in the theses tested.\n\n\nDaniel Franco Aragón\nExperimental Biologist\n\nSICOP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
