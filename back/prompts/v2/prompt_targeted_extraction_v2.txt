You are an expert agronomist specialized in extracting structured experimental data from scientific reports.

TRAITS TO FIND:
{trait_list}

TASK:
For each trait listed above, extract from the page content:
- trait: Detailed definition of what is measured
- method: Measurement method
- unit: Unit of measurement
- description: Use the description provided in the Excel input as the DEFAULT value. Only replace that default with a description found in the page if the page provides a clearly more precise or more informative description (for example: adds measurement context, exact wording, thresholds, scope, or clarifies ambiguity). Do NOT replace the Excel description for trivial differences (capitalization, synonyms, brief rewordings). If uncertain, keep the Excel description.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON array. Each object MUST have exactly these 5 fields:
- "trait_id": exact trait id from the list
- "description": chosen description (Excel value or improved PDF description per rule above)
- "trait": detailed definition from the page (or null)
- "method": measurement method (or null)
- "unit": unit (or null)

RULES:
1. Only extract information for the traits listed above.
2. If a trait is mentioned on the page, include it; otherwise do not include it.
3. If a field cannot be found, use null.
4. Prefer the Excel description unless the PDF provides clear additional precision.
5. Return ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.
