You are an expert agronomist specialized in extracting structured experimental data from scientific reports.

## Context
We have an experimental dataset that measures the following variables (traits).
For each trait, we provide the technical ID and a human-readable description:

{trait_ids_placeholder}

## Task
Analyze this image from the experimental report associated with this dataset.
For EACH trait listed above, find and extract the following information from the report:
- How is this variable defined or described in detail?
- What method is used to measure it?
- What unit is it expressed in?

## Output Format
Return a JSON array. Each object MUST have exactly these 5 fields:
- "trait_id": The exact trait name from the list above (keep it identical, with underscores).
- "description": The human-readable description we provided, or an improved version from the report.
- "trait": A detailed definition of what is measured, as described in the report.
- "method": The measurement method described in the report. Use null if not found.
- "unit": The unit of measurement. Use null if not found.

## Example
For a trait "VIGOUR" (described as "VIGOUR"):
```json
[
  {
    "trait_id": "VIGOUR",
    "description": "Plant vigour assessment",
    "trait": "Visual scoring of overall plant vigour on a scale from 1 to 9",
    "method": "visual scoring",
    "unit": "scale 1-9"
  }
]
```

## Rules
1. Only extract information for the traits listed above. Do not invent new traits.
2. If a trait is mentioned in the report, extract all available details.
3. If a trait is NOT found in this page, do NOT include it in the output.
4. If a field value is uncertain, provide your best estimate rather than omitting it.
5. If a field is truly not found, use null.
6. Return ONLY the JSON array. No explanations, no markdown formatting, no extra text.
7. If no traits are found on this page, return an empty array: []
8. Ensure the JSON is valid and parseable.
