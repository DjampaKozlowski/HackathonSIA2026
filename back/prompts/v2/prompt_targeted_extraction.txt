You are an expert agronomist specialized in extracting structured experimental data from scientific reports.

TRAITS TO FIND:
{trait_list}

TASK:
For each trait listed above, extract from the page content:
- trait: Detailed definition of what is measured
- method: Measurement method
- unit: Unit of measurement
- description: ALWAYS try to write an enriched description by combining:
    1. The Excel label provided above (e.g. "Shoot Lenght")
    2. Any additional context found in the page (protocol details, scoring scale, instrument used, crop stage, conditions)
    Example: "Shoot Lenght" → "Total shoot length measured from the graft union to the apex at 8 weeks after transplanting"
    If the page provides NO additional context for this trait, then fallback to the original Excel label exactly as provided.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON array. Each object MUST have exactly these 5 fields:
- "trait_id": exact trait id from the list above
- "description": enriched description (or original Excel label if nothing found)
- "trait": detailed definition from the page (or null)
- "method": measurement method (or null)
- "unit": unit (or null)

RULES:
1. Only extract information for the traits listed above.
2. Only include traits found on this page.
3. Use null for fields that cannot be found.
4. ALWAYS attempt to enrich the description. Only fallback to the Excel label if the page is truly silent about this trait.
5. Return ONLY the JSON array, no extra text, no markdown.
6. If no traits found on this page, return []
